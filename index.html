          <p>
            HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting
            content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and latest major
            version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
            recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML
            Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major
            browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web
            Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). HTML5 was
            first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a
            major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its
            goals were to improve the language with support for the latest
            multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily
            readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and
            devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's
            rigidity, and to remain backward-compatible with older software.
            HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and
            DOM Level 2 HTML. HTML5 includes detailed processing models to
            encourage more interoperable implementations, it extends, improves,
            and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces
            markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web
            applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for
            cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features
            designed with low-powered devices in mind. Learn more about HTML5

          <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
            describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
            language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
            Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable
            the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
            colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
            accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
            specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
            pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
            separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the
            structural content. Separation of formatting and content also makes
            it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for
            different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice
            (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
            tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
            content is accessed on a mobile device. The name "cascading" comes
            from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule
            applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This
            cascading priority scheme is predictable.

              Designing a web page involves various aspects such as layout,
              color schemes, typography, and user experience. It is important to
              create visually appealing and user-friendly designs to engage the
              audience. CSS3 provides powerful styling capabilities to enhance
              the design of web pages. By combining HTML5 for structuring the
              content and CSS3 for styling, developers can create modern and
              visually appealing web pages. Consider learning more about CSS3
              features like flexbox, grid layout, animations, and transitions to
              further enhance your web designs. Check out this CSS3 tutorial.
