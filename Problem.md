# Sprint 1 - Practice 4
***Build and Deploy an HTML 5 Application -> Applying CSS Box Model Properties***

## Objective

### Expected Outcome

Follow the template shown below for designing the web page

![Practice 4 Template](images/page-template.png)

### Design Requirements

- The page should be designed based on Web 2.0 standards using semantic HTML5 elements and CSS style properties
- Page should have a meaningful title
- This practice is an extension to Practice 3
- Based upon the template shared, each element on the page has to be styled using CSS style properties
- Usage of Box model properties is suggested.
- For eg.
    - The size of the element can be controlled by width and height properties
    - Spacing between the elements can be controlled by margin property
    - The spacing between the edge and contents of the element can be controlled by padding property
    - Wherever required float property can be used to align the element
- Ensure elements do not overlap each other

### Design Guidelines

- Across all sections of page, harmony in terms of color, font, spacing and alignment should be maintained
- Page should not allow horizontal scrolling
- Images provided in boilerplate should only be used
- Adhere to the files and folder structure provided with the boilerplate

### Code Quality Guidelines
- Usage of HTML5 semantic elements is intended in designing the structure
- Usage of CSS3 style properties is intended for styling page design
- Inline and Embedded styles should not be used
- No 3rd Party frameworks should be used for designing purpose
- Code should be well structured with proper spacing and indentation
- Meaninful names should be given to element ids and css classes
- Naming conventions should be followed
- Use Web 2.0 fonts only
- No deprecated code should be used
